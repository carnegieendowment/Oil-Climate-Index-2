      <h2 class="glossary-term" id="api-gravity">API gravity</h2>
      <p>A measure of the relative density (weight per volume) of a petroleum liquid compared to the density of water. Oils are categorized by their API gravity, as follows: extra-heavy (&lt;15 API); heavy (15–22 API); medium (22–32 API); light (32–40 API); and ultra-light (>40 API, which are included in the OCI test oils but not identified as ultra-light in Phase 1). It is commonly believed that the higher an oil’s API gravity, the lower its GHG emissions. But API gravity is not necessarily a good indicator of an oil’s total GHG emissions.</p>
